Overview Of Viscometers Market

A viscometer is an instrument used to measure the viscosity of a fluid. For liquids with viscosities which vary with flow conditions, an instrument called a rheometer is used. Viscometers only work under one flow condition.

In general, either the fluid remains stationary and an object moves through it, or the object is stationary and the fluid moves to pass it. The drag caused by relative motion of the fluid and a surface is a measure of the viscosity. The flow conditions must have a sufficiently small value of Reynolds number for there to be laminar flow.
